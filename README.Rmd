The goal of stat.tools is to have a collection of some of the most useful functions I have created over the years. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stat.tools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("FrederikkeOmicron/stat.tools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(stat.tools)
## basic example code
```
